== Description ==

The Schedule Maintenance Mode plugin allows to you quickly create a maintenance page or under construction page for Any Specific Start and end time. Simply activate the plugin, Setup Start Time, End Time, Page Title and Description then your page is ready to go.

The Schedule Maintenance worked in those situations when you wanted to launch your site at a specific date time but did not work for those instances where you needed to put WordPress into maintenance mode to perform some business procedure or update.

You can choose exactly Date time when the maintenance mode should start and finish from admin option page. There is allowing option for enable Countdown for reaming time.

You can see the maintenance mode as admin in preview mode using preview link on the settings page or simply open website in private mode or different browser to double check if it’s enabled and working. 
 
Also works with WordPress Multisite installs (each blog from the network has it’s own maintenance settings).
